# Statistics Work (Undergraduate)

GitHub Repo containing my notes and work in the following statistics modules (using **R Programming Language**): [Introduction to Research Methods](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/introduction-to-statistical-methods-PALS0046) (Year 1), [Intermediate Statistical Methods](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/intermediate-statistical-methods-PALS0045) (Year 2) of my undergraduate [MSci Psychology and Language Sciences](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/study/undergraduates/msci-psychology-and-language-sciences) degree at University College London (2019-23).

I have also added the weekly quizzes of my [Calculus and Linear Algreba](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maths/sites/maths/files/math0045.pdf) module, which I took on my first term of my second-year of undergraduate studies.

# Delivery

The stats modules consist of weekly lectures (1 hour), weekly practical class sessions (2 hours) and weekly homeworks (1-2 hours).
*PS: there were no practicals and no homeworks on Weeks 1 and 5 of Introduction to Research Methods (Year 1).*

The Calculus and Linear Algebra module consists of weekly lectures (1 hour), weekly live sessions (1h30) and weekly Quizzes.
